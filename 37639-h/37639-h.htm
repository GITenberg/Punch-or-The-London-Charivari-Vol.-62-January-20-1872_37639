<p><i>Fond Parent.</i> "<span class="smcap">I hope you will be very Careful, Mr. Stimpson. I have
always been accustomed to Cut their Hair myself.</span>"</p>

<h2>CASE OF REAL DISTRESS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> do not covet the post of Prime Minister, nor yet that of Lord Chancellor,
especially if, when Parliament re-assembles, a recent judicial appointment
should be sharply discussed. We can think of the choice of a new Speaker
without discontent with our own lowly lot, and at the present time envy of
the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas is not the predominant feeling in
our breasts. But of all places, posts, offices, appointments, and dignities
within the reach of an Englishman, the one which excites in us the least desire
is that of "Examiner of Plays."</p>

<p>Who, with a heart, can resist feelings of the deepest commiseration, the
most profound pity for the sufferings of another, when he hears that in twelve
short years it has been the unhappy lot of the present Examiner to read one
thousand eight hundred dramatic pieces&mdash;one thousand eight hundred tragedies,
comedies, melodramas, farces, pantomimes, burlesques, and extravaganzas?
There are labours which no salary can remunerate, services which no fees can
requite.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A DISTINGUISHED "FRIEND."</h2>

<blockquote>
"In consideration of a costly present which <span class="smcap">Mr. Joseph Pease</span>, of South-end, Darlington,
has made to the Spanish nation, the young King of that country has conferred
upon him the Grand Cross of a Spanish order, and <span class="smcap">Mr. Pease</span>, who is a Quaker, has
agreed to accept the distinction."&mdash;<i>Echo.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Quaker</span> a Grand Cross! We should as soon have expected to be introduced
to a Quaker Field Marshal. Henceforth the sensation of surprise must be
numbered amongst the lost feelings. Nothing now can move us more. Not
the sun rising in the west, not the spectacle of an Irish Roman Catholic Bishop
teaching in a Protestant Sunday school, not a Teetotal Lord Mayor, not the
appointment of <span class="smcap">Mr. Tomline</span> as Master of the Mint, or <span class="smcap">Sir Charles Dilke</span>
as Lord-Lieutenant of Middlesex, not the total abolition of the Income Tax, not
the conversion of <span class="smcap">Mr. Whalley</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr. Newdegate</span> to Popery, not the
purification of the streets,&mdash;no, not even the bestowal of the Grand Cross of
our own Order of the Bath on some Englishman eminent in Art, Literature, or
Science!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">eally</span>, greatness has its multifold inconvenience.
<i>Falstaff</i> wished that
his name were not so terrible to the
enemy, as he should then be less urgently
called upon to go and fight.
<i>Mr. Punch</i> wishes that his works were not so universally attractive,
as he should not then have to answer so many questions about them.
He has actually had to receive a Deputation upon the subject of his
splendid and unparalleled Pocket-Book for 1872. It appears that
certain improvements which he introduced into the volume have
given the most enormous and outrageous satisfaction to the majority
of mankind, and that the demand for the book has been excessive&mdash;almost
inconvenient. But a minority of excellent persons, who hate
all kinds of changes, have complained that by taking out certain
blank pages, he has prevented the complainants from embalming
their own observations by the side of his preternatural wit and
humour. As aforesaid, a Deputation on the subject approached the
presence last Saturday. <i>Mr. Punch</i>, of course, listened with his
usual affability. The strong points of the applicants were, that they
had been accustomed for years to write their own biographies and
engagements in the sacred volume, and that the record of their lives
thus became nearly imperishable, as no one in his right senses would
ever destroy a <i>Punch's Pocket-Book</i>. They therefore humbly
begged him to restore the old form.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> smiled, and gently said that of course he must be the
best judge of what his friend the Universe required at his hands,
and this proposition was conceded with respectful acclamation. He
might just suggest that his Pocket-Book, although a precious jewel,
was not a thing to be locked up in a cabinet, but one to be the
light and joy of a household for a year, but it might not be so
evident that personal entries, as "<i>Charles very cross"&mdash;"Sweet
letter from Arabella,</i>" "<i>Bless Smithson's mistletoe!</i>" "<i>I hate Aunt
Popkins</i>," "<i>Said I had not dined at Greenwich:" "Ridiculous
sermon by new curate</i>," and the like, were equally adapted for the
perusal of the said household. Such things might be confided to a
humbler receptacle. But the pleas being renewed, without reference
to the answer (we need hardly remark that most of his visitors
were of the sex "that can't argue, and pokes fires from the top," as
good <span class="smcap">Archbishop Whatley</span> said) <i>Mr. Punch</i> blandly promised
that the views of the deputation should receive the utmost consideration
at his hands. And when he had thus spoken he dismissed
the assembly&mdash;or rather conducted it to a sumptuous, yet
delicate lunch.</p>

<h2>EVENINGS FROM HOME.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next evening <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> was dressed in an unusual style of
elegance: every article of his attire was of the most exquisite cut;
every species of ornament that fashion permitted to decorate his
person was his; not a stud was omitted, nor was one drop, less than
necessary, of india-rubber-boot-polish forgotten that could tend to
render his toilet perfect. And, indeed, neither <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> nor
<span class="smcap">Harry</span> were far behind him in appearance on this memorable occasion,
which was nothing less than that of their first visit to the
<span class="smcap">Royal Grecian Theatre</span>, in the City Road.</p>

<p>Here, from their stalls (which were remarkably inexpensive,
being, indeed, only one shilling and sixpence each) they surveyed
the wonderful sight which presented itself to them, of a house
densely packed from the floor to the ceiling.</p>

<p>The Pantomime was the only piece played, and was entitled
<i>Zig-Zag, the Crooked</i>. When <span class="smcap">Mr. George Conquest</span>, who represented
<i>Zig-Zag</i> himself, first appeared, as if hewn out of the rock,
inanimate as the Sphinx, a thrill of astonishment ran through
the audience, which gradually showed itself in vehement applause
when <i>Zig-Zag's</i> fearful eyes began to move, as at the command of
the Young Prince, the monster became endued with life and descended
from the rock.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> I declare this is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Indeed, you are right, and I could not have conceived
anyone being at once so hideous and so diverting.</p>

<p>Presently there was a brilliant scene, in which there were some
admirable selections from the works of various composers, principally
French, executed in a manner so creditable to the performers, as to
call forth from <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> the remark that he had heard nothing
better of its kind in any Theatre this year. When <span class="smcap">Mr. Conquest</span>
and his Son leaped several times from the stage to the top scenes
("which" <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> informed his pupils "are termed flies"),
and tumbled through trap-doors, coming up again so quickly, and in
so great a variety of places all over the "boards," that the audience
was in a state of constant excitement as to what next might be going
to happen; and when finally <i>Zig-Zag</i> took such a header, as <span class="smcap">Harry</span>
had seen the big boys at school do, when they were going to dive for
chalk eggs, from the flies right through the stage, and was lost to
all eyes, then the enthusiastic admiration of <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> and his
young friends knew no bounds, and they evinced their pleasure, as
did the rest of the company, in such rounds of applause as brought
on <span class="smcap">Mr. Conquest</span> and his Son, without their wigs and false noses,
to bow their acknowledgments.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The following night they went to the <span class="smcap">Gaiety</span> to witness the performance
of <span class="smcap">Mr. Toole</span> in <i>Dearer than Life</i>, which <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>
had seen before, and in <i>Thespis</i>, the Christmas novelty at this
theatre.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> If you please, Sir, what sort of piece is this?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Indeed, my dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, I cannot exactly tell.
And it is nearly impossible for an ordinarily well-instructed person
to comprehend the precise meaning of any one subject on which
those who should know best are apparently disagreed, and who, in
consequence, signally fail in rendering their own meaning intelligible
in the public.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> That is true, Sir, and I perceive that you have noticed
how, at various times, this same piece has been announced as a
"Musical Extravaganza," an "Operatic Burlesque," a "Grotesque
Drama, illustrated with music by <span class="smcap">Mr. Sullivan</span>," a "Comic Opera,"
and lately an English Opera Bouffe. As perhaps next week it may
be styled a <i>Tragicomicopera</i>, or some other title, I would like, Sir,
to join <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> in his question as to what you suppose this piece really
to be?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Why, then, for my part, I suppose it is intended for
a specimen of English <i>Opéra bouffe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And what, Sir, is <i>Opéra bouffe</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> It is a French burlesque&mdash;a vehicle for extravagances
in costume, in acting, and in singing. It is in one, two, three,
or even five Acts, and differs from the English burlesque in that it is
written in prose, and depends mainly for its success upon the original
music written for it by some composer, instead of on selections from
various popular sources. In this piece, for example, the dialogue is
prosy&mdash;I mean in prose&mdash;and the music has been written to suit it.
I think we may, therefore, suppose this piece to be an English <i>Opéra
bouffe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tommy</i> (<i>during the First Act</i>). I do not understand what characters
these worthy people represent who are trying their best to
divert us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, who had been giving the play his closest attention,
seemed to be unable to enlighten his pupil, and requested him to
listen to what was going on, and occasionally refer to the programme,
by which means he would probably arrive at some definite conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Truly, Sir, this piece reminds me of what you told me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page025" id="page025"></a>[pg 025]</span>
about <span class="smcap">Newton's</span> <i>Laws of Motion</i>, and I look forward to being very
happy and lively to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> I am glad to hear it, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>. But how do you
connect such a result with the <i>Laws of Motion</i>?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Because, Sir, you told me that "Forces acting and reacting
are always equal and contrary to each other." So, Sir, after
this night is over, we may fairly expect a most exhilarating reaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> was so much struck by this fresh instance of <span class="smcap">Harry's</span>
capacity for adapting his learning to whatever circumstances might
present themselves, that he determined to learn the science of mechanics
on the very first opportunity.</p>

<p>The audience continued to listen to the piece with a serenity
which nothing could disturb, except the occasional appearance of
<span class="smcap">Mr. Toole</span>, who gave utterance to such quaint drolleries, of his own
introduction, as sent the people into short spasms of laughter, in
which <span class="smcap">Master Tommy</span> most heartily joined, while <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>
applauded as loudly as the rest of the company. But <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, whose
temper was not quite so pliable, could not conceal the weariness that
was gradually creeping over him. He gaped, he yawned, he stretched,
he even pinched himself in order to keep his attention alive, but all
in vain. He managed to rouse himself twice; once when <span class="smcap">Mr. Toole</span>
was singing an additional verse to his song (where, indeed, the
accompaniment, consisting-of railway noises, would not let him
sleep), and once when <span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Clary</span> was exercising her
skill in a rather pretty melody. But at length the narcotic influence
of the dialogue, conspiring with the opiate charms of the music, he
could resist no longer, but insensibly fell back upon his stall, fast
asleep. This was soon remarked by his neighbours, who straightway
conceived an unfavourable opinion of <span class="smcap">Harry's</span> breeding, while he,
in the meantime, enjoyed the most placid repose, undisturbed by
either the envious remarks of some among the audience, or by the
nudgings administered to his elbow by his friend <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>; and,
indeed, his slumber was not entirely dissipated until the performance
was finished.</p>

<p><i>Harry</i> (<i>on their return to their Lodgings</i>). Your remarks, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>,
to-night remind me of the story of <i>Polemo</i> and the <i>Continuous
Highlander</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> here made some excuse for retiring to his room; and
as <span class="smcap">Harry</span> was on the point of commencing the story, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> asked
him to await his return, as he was only going to fetch his slippers,
in order to sit and listen more comfortably to his friend's narrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> consented to wait for him, but, at the end of two hours, as
<span class="smcap">Tommy</span> did not return, he retired to his own room, and soon fell
asleep.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE FOURTH R IN MERTHYR.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> an article which appeared the other day our orthodox contemporary,
the <i>Western Mail</i>, criticised certain late proceedings of
the Merthyr School Board relative to the Fourth R difficulty in
Education. Those proceedings, says that respectable journal, "were
saved from being utterly ludicrous only by the gravity of the subjects
which were under discussion." But for that consideration,
the <i>Western Mail</i> is of opinion that it would have been good fun
"to watch the efforts that were being made to realise that most
delusive of all theoretical ideas&mdash;unsectarian as opposed to secular
education." Perhaps most persons will think that those efforts
were, as far as they went, not altogether unsuccessful, seeing that,
after some discussion bearing on theology, the Board concluded, on
the motion of one of its principal Members&mdash;a lady interested in the
welfare of her species, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Crawshay</span> of Cyfartha&mdash;that the sole
form of devotion, public or private, dictated by the Founder of
Christianity, "should be the sole form of public devotion employed
in the schools." The <span class="smcap">Rev. John Griffiths</span>, the Rector, "intimated
that he would be quite contented with the proposed limitation of
the form of prayer, provided that a doxology were added, recognising"
a doctrine which Unitarians do not recognise. The suggestion
certainly was creditable to a clergyman of the Church of
England who keeps a conscience. It was professional; but the
doxology is one of those special matters in the Fourth R on which
professors, and doctors too, differ. The orthodoxology of one
denomination is the heterodoxology of another.</p>

<p>There are forms of public devotion in common use as the prologue
to public dinners. They are invocations in which all present can
join, whatever their belief may be as to the Fourth R&mdash;if they have
any belief at all&mdash;and if they have none, what then? It would be
conscientious of a Church of England Clergyman to propose the
superaddition of a Doxology to a Grace; but would it be wise?
Would it not probably set a company of mixed denominations quarrelling
over their soup?</p>

<p>In relation to food for the mind, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Crawshay</span> proposed to deal
with the Fourth R in a way analogous to that which experience has
proved the most convenient method of adjoining it to food for the
body. Herein she has acted on principles which many persons,
besides a writer in the <i>Western Mail</i>, may call "illogical and unsafe,"
but no thinking man, or woman either, would call those
persons philosophers. If every School Board were to legislate as
to the Fourth R simply on the principle of teaching just so much of
it as children can be expected to understand, would not their practical
arrangement be of necessity about the same as that recommended
by <span class="smcap">Mrs. Crawshay</span>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ig</span> books are big evils, says some
old Greek, not of the vigorous
type here depicted. <i>Mr. Punch</i>
seldom agrees with anybody,
and he distinctly disagrees with
the Ancient in question. One
big book, for instance, which is
no evil, but a good, is <i>Kelly's
Post-Office Directory</i>, with
which he has been favoured,
and which he has been perusing
with avidity ever since it arrived.
It was remarked to a clownish
servant, who was eating away
at a vast Cheshire cheese, that
he was a long time at supper,
and his triumphant answer was
that a cheese of that size was
not got through in a hurry. The
remark, but not the clownishness,
is adopted by <i>Mr. Punch</i>
in regard to the Kelly Book.
He has, as yet, read only the
first thousand pages or so, but
he intends to complete his
labour. The volume contains
the name and address of everybody,
in London or the suburbs,
whose name and address anybody
can possibly want. <i>Mr. Punch's</i> own grand and brilliant
idea is, to do with <span class="smcap">Kelly</span> something like what <span class="smcap">Bayle</span> did for
<span class="smcap">Moreri</span>. He meditates issuing a <i>Kelly</i> with vast notes of his own,
in which he proposes to give a biography and anecdotes of everybody
mentioned in the original book. As there will be several
thousand volumes, the work must be published by subscriptions,
which perhaps <span class="smcap">Mr. Kelly</span> will be good enough to canvass and collect
for <i>Mr. Punch</i>. The <i>Kelly-Punch Biography</i> will be a production
worthy the gigantic genius of the age, and <i>Mr. Punch</i> admits that
his collaborateur has admirably done <i>his</i> part of the work.</p>

<h2>HISTORIANS AND HERETICS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> attempting to enforce the Infallibility Dogma on those inconsistent
people, who, calling themselves Old Catholics, have seceded
from Popery in exercising their private judgment, and refusing,
though ordered by an &OElig;cumenical Council, to eat dirt, the Archbishops
of the Roman Obedience appear to be waking snakes. The
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> a few days since, said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"It was announced in our latest edition yesterday, that the <span class="smcap">Archbishop of
Munich</span> has excommunicated <span class="smcap">Professor Froschhammer</span>. To-day a German
correspondent informs us that the Professor has published an essay, in which
he proves that the Catholic Clergy are all excommunicated for adopting the
Copernican system and taking interest on money."
</blockquote>

<p>Professors <span class="smcap">Froschhammer</span> and <span class="smcap">Döllinger</span>, however, are snakes in
a more serious sense than the ordinary cobras, rattle-snakes, copperheads,
and vipers in general which the Fathers of the Lateran
Council would mean by snakes, as a name for heretics. Hitherto
heretics have been regarded by the Roman Catholic hierarchy as
vipers which, in impugning Authority, bite a file. The above-named
Professors appeal to History against the <span class="smcap">Pope</span>. <span class="smcap">Dr. Manning</span> may
declare this appeal to be treason. He might add that it is undeniable
treason. The reproach of treason lies in failure.</p>

<p class="center">
"But when it prospers none dare call it treason."
</p>

<p>Such snakes as <span class="smcap">Professor Döllinger</span> and <span class="smcap">Professor Froschhammer</span>
bite things more vulnerable than files. They bite legs and
feet, through scarlet stockings, and white satin cross-embroidered
slippers.</p>

<h2>A Creed Miscalled.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> researches of <span class="smcap">Mr. Ffoulkes</span> and other learned investigators
appear to have proved that the creed of St. Athanasius, so-called,
was not composed until ages after the decease of that personage. If
so, it was unduly entitled with his name. Considering the purport
of certain generally unpopular clauses in Athanasius his Creed, one
conceives that it might, perhaps, be more appropriately styled the
Creed of Anathema-maran-athanasius.</p>

<h2>UN MONSIEUR SMITH.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the news of the other day appeared the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"Two Frenchmen, one of whom, however, gives the name of <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, are in
custody, charged with the commission of several burglaries in the suburbs of
the Metropolis."
</blockquote>

<p>You would have liked to hear one of the Frenchmen give the
name of <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. His tongue, surely, betrayed him. <span class="smcap">M. Vaurien</span>,
or whatever his real name was, of course, in attempting to give the
name of <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, gave that of <span class="smcap">Smeet</span> or <span class="smcap">Smis</span>. Give the name of
<span class="smcap">Smith</span>, indeed! A Frenchman might as well try to give the password

<h2>A WORKING MAN ON WORK.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the National Congress of Trades Societies at Nottingham, last
week, a <span class="smcap">Mr. Graham</span> said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"In his opinion it was one of the rights of a free man to cease work when
he wished, either for reasonable or even unreasonable causes."
</blockquote>

<p>This is so exactly <i>Mr. Punch's</i> belief that, wishing at this identical
moment to cease work, for the reasonable or unreasonable cause
that he feels more inclined to smoke, he knocks off, without appending
any proper and moral observations to <span class="smcap">Mr. Graham's</span> <i>dictum</i>.
Whether <span class="smcap">Mr. Graham</span> keeps any sort of servant, and if so, whether
<span class="smcap">Mr. Graham</span> recognises the right in question when he wants his
beer fetched, or his boots cleaned, is the only query that <i>Mr. Punch</i>
chooses to exert himself to put. But he must add that the world
would go on delightfully if this rule were always acted upon; and
he is glad that the Trade Societies are enlightened enough to do their
best to bring on a Millennium.</p>

<h2>Suggestion to Mr. Lowe.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Lay</span> a heavy tax on all persons telling old jokes, making old puns.
Let the tax be doubled in the case of any person attempting to pass
off such old joke or pun as "a good thing he's just heard," or as
"a funny thing that happened to his cousin the other day." <span class="smcap">Mr.
Lowe</span> will find public-spirited men ready to hand in nearly all clubs
who will voluntarily give their services, and for a moderate percentage
will act as Collectors of this particular form of taxation at
every dinner-party (where the name and address of the offender
will be taken down), and in Society's drawing-rooms. This and
a tax on photographs will bring in a handsome additional revenue
for Eighteen-Seventy-Two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">e</span> somehow turn the dinner conversation upon
some peculiar way of cultivating mangel. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>
looks at Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>, and, alluding to the
last speaker's remark, whatever it was, says, "Aha!
that isn't the way we grow mangel in the South,
is it, <span class="smcap">Mr. Ruddock</span>?" and therewith gives Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> such a
humorous look, as if they had, between them, several good jokes
about mangel, which, when told by Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>, would set the
table in a roar.</p>

<p>I turn towards him with a propitiatory smile, as much as to say,
"You see I'm ready for any of your funny stories." Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>
glances up at me from his plate (he hasn't looked up much since
the beginning of dinner), and replies, gravely and simply, "No."
Whereat <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> almost roars with laughter, and nods at me
knowingly, as if asking if <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> isn't a character. He may be.
Perhaps it requires the wine to draw him out, but he hasn't, as yet,
said anything funny or witty; in fact, he hasn't said anything at
all. The conversation, otherwise, is general and well distributed.
Topics principally local.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, it is not unlike being suddenly given a
bass part in a quintette, where the other four know their music off
by heart. I speak from experience, remembering how, in the instance
alluded to, I came in wherever I could, with very remarkable
effect, and generally at least an octave too low, leaving off with the
feeling that if we had been encored (of which there wasn't, under
the circumstances, the slightest possible chance), I should have come
out very strong, and <i>quite</i> in tune. As it was, I had first to find
my voice, which seemed to have gone down like the mercury in a
barometer on a cold day, and having succeeded in producing it, I
had then to issue it in notes.</p>

<p>During dinner I am frequently brought into the conversation,
apologetically, and appealed to out of politeness, as "probably not
taking much interest in these matters."</p>

<p>The matters in question are usually something vexatious with
regard to paupers, a political question deeply mixed up with the
existence of the Yeomanry, the state of the roads in the next district,
the queer temper of a neighbouring clergyman, the difficulty of
dealing with Old <span class="smcap">Somebody</span> at a vestry meeting, the right of some
parish authorities to bury somebody who oughtn't, or ought, to have
been buried without somebody else's consent; the best mode of
making a preserve, a difference of opinion as to varieties of cider, the
probabilities of a marriage between <span class="smcap">Tre-someone</span> of Tre-somewhere
with <span class="smcap">Pol-somebody</span> of Pol-something else, and so forth. On consideration,
I <i>am</i> interested. For, to a reflective mind, is not all this the
interior mechanism of the Great British Constitution? Of course.</p>

<p>The only thing that Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> says the whole time, is that he
wouldn't keep Cochin China fowls even if they were given him.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you?" exclaims <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>, looking slily at me and
beginning to laugh, evidently in anticipation of some capital story,
or a witticism from <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>. No, not another word. He is, it
strikes me, reserving himself. I turn to my partner, and try to
interest her in Ramsgate, Torquay, the Turkish bath, London and
Paris news. She doesn't like Torquay, has never been to Ramsgate,
and from what she has heard of it thinks it must be vulgar (to
which I return, "O, dear no," but haven't got any proof that it
isn't. I find out that she goes every season to London, and knows
more about operas than I do, and finally was brought up in Paris,
and generally stops there for a month yearly with her Aunt, so that
I am unable to give her any information on my special subjects, and
as she clearly wants to listen to some story which <span class="smcap">Tregony</span> of
Tregivel, on the other side of her, is telling, I feel that I'd better
continue my dinner silently, or draw <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> out. I try it, but
<span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> won't come out.</p>

<p><i>Dessert.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tregony</span> of Tregivel <i>does</i> come out genially, without
the process of drawing. He has some capital Cornish stories, with
an inimitable imitation of Cornish dialect.</p>

<p><i>Flash.</i>&mdash;While he is telling a rather long anecdote to think of
something good and new to cap it. Why not something with (also)
an imitation of dialect, or brogue. I've got a very good thing
about a Scotchman, but can't remember it in time.</p>

<p>Odd how stories slip away from you just at the moment you
especially want to remember them. During a pause in the conversation
I remember my story, and secure attention for it by
suddenly asking <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> (which startles him) if "he's ever heard,"
&amp;c., and of course he, politely, hasn't. Odd. Somehow, this evening
I <i>can't</i> recall the Scotch accent. I try a long speech (not usually
belonging to the story) in Scotch, so as to work myself up to it, but,
somehow or other, it will run into Irish. My story, therefore, takes
somewhat this form. I say, "Then the Scotchman called out,
'Och, bedad'&mdash;I mean, 'Ye dinna ken'"&mdash;and so forth. Result,
failure. But might tell it later, when I'm really in the humour,
which I evidently am <i>not</i> now, and yet I thought I was.</p>

<p>Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> begins to come out, not as a <i>raconteur</i>, but as an
interrupter, which is a new phase of character.</p>

<p>For example, <span class="smcap">Tregony</span> commences one of his best Cornish stories,
to which we are all listening attentively, something about an uncle
and a nephew, and a cart.</p>

<p>"They went," says <span class="smcap">Tregony</span>, "to buy a cart"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"A what?" says <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>, really giving his whole mind to it.</p>

<p>"A cart," answers <span class="smcap">Tregony</span>.</p>

<p>"O," returns <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>, "I beg pardon. Yes, well"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well," resumes <span class="smcap">Tregony</span>, "they wanted something cheap, as
they had no use for it except to get home,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get what?" asks <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>.</p>

<p>"Home," replies <span class="smcap">Tregony</span>, evidently a bit nettled.</p>

<p>"Oh, ah! yes," returns <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>. "Home&mdash;well?"</p>

<p>"Well," <span class="smcap">Tregony</span> continues, looking towards his opposite neighbour,
so as to avoid Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> if possible, "the landlord of the
Inn says to them, 'I'll lend you and <span class="smcap">Nevvy Bill</span> a cart&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruddock's</span> in again with "A what?"</p>

<p>I can't help turning upon him, and saying, rather angrily, "A
cart!" I feel inclined to add, "You old idiot." Then I say to
<span class="smcap">Tregony</span>, encouragingly, "Yes."</p>

<p>"'Only' (continues <span class="smcap">Tregony</span>), says the Landlord, joking them,
'mind yew du bring the wheels back safe and sound.' So they
promised, and then they went about the town till it was rather late
and getting dark&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Getting <i>what</i>?" asks Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>. Everybody annoyed, and
two persons besides myself repeat the word "dark" to him.</p>

<p>With these interruptions, and the consequent necessity of making
it all quite clear, specially when it comes to <span class="smcap">Tregony</span> imitating the
conversation between Uncle and Nephew, in two voices, when Old
<span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> perpetually wants to know "<i>Who</i> said that," and so
puzzles <span class="smcap">Tregony</span> that sometimes he makes the Uncle take the
Nephew's voice, and <i>vice versâ</i>, and the story is getting into difficulties,
when the servant enters with a message to our Host from
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Pendell</span>, which brings us to our feet, and into the drawing-room,
<span class="smcap">Tregony</span> promising me the story quietly in a corner.</p>

<p>The other ladies have come. We all try to enter the drawing-room
carelessly, as if the ladies weren't there, or as if we'd been
engaged in some fearful conspiracy in the next room, and were
hiding our consciousness of guilt under a mask of frivolity. <span class="smcap">Miss
Bodd</span>, of Popthlanack, is alone at a table, turning over the pages of
a photographic album. I join her.</p>

<p><i>Careful Flash.</i>&mdash;Take care never to offer an opinion on photographic
or any other sort of portraits, unless you're quite sure of
your ground.</p>

<p>I remark generally that I don't care about photographic portraits.
Before <span class="smcap">Miss Bodd</span> can answer, I hear a rustle behind me, and a
voice asks simply, "Why?"</p>

<p>Good gracious! <i>It is</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Miss Straithmere</span>! She is staying with
the <span class="smcap">Clethers</span> ["<span class="smcap">Mr. Clether</span> is here," <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> tells me. "He's
written a work on the Moon. Quite a character&mdash;&mdash;"], and as the
<span class="smcap">Rev. Mr. Clether</span> is the Rector of Penwiffle, she is not a mile from
the house, and will be here every day.</p>

<p>Singing and playing. <span class="smcap">Miss Straithmere</span> asks me, "Why I'm
so serious? Will I tell her? <i>Do. Why?</i>"</p>

<p>I expect <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> to sing. He doesn't. <span class="smcap">Mr. Clether</span> is talking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page030" id="page030"></a>[pg 030]</span>
to him. I join them. I am anxious to hear
what <span class="smcap">Mr. Clether's</span> view of the Moon is.
He replies, "O, nothing particular."</p>

<p>"But," I urge, <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> listening, "You
have made a study of astronomy, and in
these days"&mdash;I slip at this moment, because
I don't know exactly what I was going to
say; but I rather fancy it was that "In
these days the moon isn't what it was."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Clether</span> modestly repudiates knowing
more about the moon than other people,
and says that <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> is right about his
having written a book, but he has never
published it.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i>?" asks <span class="smcap">Miss Straithmere</span>, joining
us.</p>

<p>Carriages. Thank goodness!</p>

<p>I accompany <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> to the door. He
has a gig, and a lantern, like a Guy Fawkes
out for an airing.</p>

<p>I am still expecting a witticism, or rather
a <i>feu de joie</i> of humour and fun, like the last
grand bouquet of fireworks that terminates
the show at the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendell</span> (who I believe is still drawing
him out) says to him, "You'll have a fine
night for your drive," then looks at me
and laughs, as much as to say, "<i>Now</i> you'll
hear him, <i>now</i> it's coming. He's shy before
a party, but <i>now</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> replies, from above, in his gig,
"Yes, so it seems. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And away goes the vehicle, turns the
corner, and disappears from view in the
avenue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendell</span> chuckles to himself. "Quite a
character," I hear him murmuring. Then,
after a short laugh, he exclaims almost
fondly, "Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>! ha! ha! Rum
old fellow."</p>

<p>And so we go in. And this has been the
long-expected "Nicht wi' <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>." He
hasn't said twenty words. Certainly not
one worth hearing. Yet <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> seems
perfectly satisfied with him, and years
hence, I dare say, this occasion will be recounted
as a night when Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> was
at his best. After this, how about <span class="smcap">Sheridan</span>?</p>

<p><i>Next morning.</i>&mdash;My friend, <span class="smcap">Miss Straithmere</span>,
is coming at two o'clock. I find that
I can leave, <i>viâ</i> Launceston, at eleven. I
am not well. I can't help it. I begin to
consider, is it my nature to be ill? No, I
must go up to town, and consult my Doctor.</p>

<p>Adieu, Penwiffle. If I stopped, I feel
that in the wilds of Cornwall, out at Tintagel
or at Land's End, or in a slate quarry,
or down a mine, I should.... Well, I
don't know but I should have to answer
the question, "Why?"</p>

<p>My present idea is to live in London,
about two miles from the British Museum.
Then I can walk there every morning, and
work in the library at my <i>Analytical History
of Motion</i>.</p>

<p>If the Doctor agrees with me, and if this
plan agrees with me, I shall continue it; if
not, I must take to boxing, gymnastics, or
other violent exercise.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Doctor <i>does</i> agree with me. He
advises me to try my own prescription. In
a week's time to call on him again, and go
on calling on him regularly every Monday.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I have taken lodgings three doors from
my Doctor's house. I shall make no further
notes, unless, at some future time, I commence
a history of a British Constitution (my
own). And so, for the present, I conclude,
with a quotation from <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, who
was, among other things, evidently a valetudinarian,
and finish these papers by saying,</p>

<h2>IN THE TEMPLE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Derby</span> has made a political speech of a very sensible character&mdash;"that goes
without to say" in his case. He tells the Conservatives that they are to be neither apathetic
nor precipitate, that they are to play a waiting game&mdash;the World to him who can Wait&mdash;and,
meantime, they are to support <span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span> against the extreme men on his own
side. And, said the Earl, "political life is not to be looked at as if it were a soaped pole,
with £5,000 a year, and lots of patronage at the top." The sentiment is lofty and honourable.
"But," said to <i>Mr. Punch</i> a rising lawyer, who intends to rise a good deal higher,
"the deuce of it is that <span class="smcap">Lord Derby</span> talks from the top of a golden Pyramid about
soaped poles. Hang it! I'm like <i>Becky Sharp</i>&mdash;I should find it precious easy to be patriotic
with fifty thousand a year. If I didn't feel I could manage the nation for the best (though
of course I could), confound it! I'd myself engage the best Premier that money could
secure, and serve the country that way. But blow it, as it is, and <span class="smcap">Henrietta's</span> governor
refusing to hear of me until I'm in Parliament, you see, old cuss&mdash;&mdash;" "Virtue alone is
happiness below," replied <i>Mr. Punch</i> severely, as he went away to get some oysters at
<span class="smcap">Prosser's</span>.</p>

<h2>A BURIED ARMY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Leeds Mercury</i> is such an excellent paper, that
<i>Punch</i> takes from it anything as unhesitatingly as (to
use <span class="smcap">Lord Lytton's</span> illustration) one takes change from
an honest tradesman, without looking at or counting the
coins. That journal said, the other day&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"There was a demonstration at Lausanne yesterday, in memory
of the soldiers belonging to <span class="smcap">General Bourbaki's</span> army who died
in Switzerland, after being interred there last year."
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot see why there should have been a demonstration;
at least, if it was a demonstration of wonder,
the wonder would have been if the soldiers had survived
their interment. It was Antæus, if we recollect aright,
whose strength was renewed when he came in contact
with the Earth, but he never went under it, at least not
until Alcides had done with and for him. But is France
aware that this is the way in which one of her armies
was got rid of? Is this the boasted hospitality of Switzerland?</p>

<h2>AMERICAN INCREDULITY.</h2>

<p>In a speech delivered at New York on "Forefathers' Day," the
<span class="smcap">Rev. Henry Beecher</span>, discoursing of the "Pilgrim Fathers," said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"That they had their faults we all know. They brought with them some
of the prejudices of Europe, and had not freed themselves from notions of persecution.
They believed, above all things, in the existence and power of the
evil one. The devil was everywhere in their thoughts. In our modern times
we have gone free from that superstition. We of New York know there is no
such being."
</blockquote>

<p>In the early days of New England anyone who owned to being
an Adiabolist would have been deemed an Atheist. But then
there was no Tammany or Erie Ring. Plunder and fraud, picking
and stealing, are courses from which some natures can only be
restrained by the piety which firmly believes in the personality,
cornute and caudal, of <span class="smcap">Milton's</span> hero. "We of New York know
there is no such being." Do we? We think we do, but may have
flattered ourselves.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
